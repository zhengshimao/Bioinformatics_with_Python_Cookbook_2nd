AB: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanisms of the effect of Actinidia chinensis polysaccharide (ACPS) on the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer cells. METHODS: BGC-823-Luc gastric cancer cells stably transfected with a luciferase gene were used to establish an insitutransplanted tumor mouse model. A live mouse imaging system was used to observe tumor growth, and hematoxylin and eosin staining was applied to analyze tissue histopathology. Transwell and scratch wound assays were performed to examine the invasive and migratory ability of BGC-823 cells. Immunofluorescence, confocal microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot assays were used to analyze the expressions of the nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins. RESULTS: ACPS significantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneously transplanted BGC-823-Luc gastric cancer tumors in nude mice and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration in tumor tissues. ACPS inhibited Epidermal Growth Factor-induced invasion, migration, and morphological changes in the cytoskeleton of BGC-823 cells. ACPS inhibited gastric cancer EMT and decreased the expression of matrix metallopeptidase 9, N-cadherin and p-NF-kappaB p65 in transplanted tumor tissues. ACPS inhibited the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and vascular adhesion factors in BGC-823 cells, promoted p65-NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, and regulated proteins associated with the NF-kappaB p65 pathway. CONCLUSIONS: ACPS inhibited gastric cancer invasion and metastasis both in vivo and in vitro, which evidenced the inhibition of gastric cancer EMT viaregulating the NF-kappaB inflammatory pathway.
